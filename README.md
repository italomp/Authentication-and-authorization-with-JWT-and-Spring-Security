# Security Rest Api
This API contains CRUD operations more authentication and authorization implemented with Spring Boot, JWT and Spring Security.


## Tutorial
I used this tutorial (https://auth0.com/blog/implementing-jwt-authentication-on-spring-boot/) to implement this code. <br>
It uses gradle, but i switched to maven.
